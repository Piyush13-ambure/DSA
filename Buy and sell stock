The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get

#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // If today's price is higher than yesterday's, sell the stock
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
};

/*In a town plagued by thieves, the mayor has a list of n thieves that are scheduled to be caught, numbered 1 through n. Each thief:

Has a threat level ai (positive integer), and
Belongs to a specific gang type b? (an integer between 1 and m inclusive).
To aid in the operation, the mayor can assign up to m special guards, one per gang. The guard of gang type j can neutralize all threats from that gang's thieves.
The mayor begins the operation with a total preparedness level h (his ability to endure threats without failing the mission). The plan is carried out in order from thief 1 to thief n, following these steps:
For each thief i = 1 to n, as long as preparedness is positive:
If no guard is assigned for the gang b?:

The thief deals a? threat to the mayor (subtract a? from h).
If after that, h > 0:

The thief is captured.
Otherwise:

The mayor fails, and no more thieves can be dealt with.
You are to solve the following task for every possible number of guards k= 0, 1, â€¦, m:
Determine the maximum number of thieves that the mayor can successfully capture when he assigns exactly k guards (choosing them from the available m gang types)*/
